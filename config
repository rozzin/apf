# This is an example configuration file for active forwarder
# Firstly, we have to declare our files with key and certificate

certificate	cacert.pem

# Please note, that we can place only blank characters between words

key		server.rsa

# when we want to log some information, we specify file for lightlog
# when we want to log everything - we do this by using heavylog option

# type		name of file

lightlog	logfile
#heavylog	logfile


# And it's time for create forwarding targets (named realms here)

#newrealm indicates a new set of commands to a server
newrealm

#options        values

hostname  <yourhostname> #this is a name of the server (it's using it for choosing interface)
listen    50127          #portnumber on which server is listening for users
manage    50126         #portnumber on which server is listening for afclient
#users     5           #amount of users we are allowing to connect (>0) (default: 5)
#timeout   5          #timeout value for the client's connection (>0) (default: 5)
#clients   1          #number of allowed clients for this realm (>0) (default: 1)
#usrpcli   $users     #allowed users per client for this realm (>0) (default: $users)
#climode   1          #strategy used for connecting users with clients (1) (default: 1)
#proto     tcp       #type of the realm (which protocol it will forward (tcp|udp) (default: tcp)
#pass   mypassword  #this is a password used for client identification

# and now the second realm
