GRAY-WORLD.NET / Active Port Forwarder
==========================

  The Active Port Forwarder program is part of the Gray-World.net projects.

  Our Gray-World Team presents on the http://gray-world.net website the projects
  and publications we are working on which  are  related  to  the  NACS (Network
  Access Control System)  bypassing  research  field  and  to  the  computer and
  network security topics.

================================================================================


Active port forwarder is a software for secure port forwarding.
It uses ssl for increasing security of communication between server and client.

Af is dedicated for people, who don't have external ip number and want to
make some services available across the net.

Moreover, zlib is used to compress transfered data.

EXAMPLE 1:

The use of it is extremely simple. Let's suppose we want to create http server on
our computer and we are behind masquerade or firewall:

1) We have to find some machine on the net with external ip and shell account.

2) Use make to compile everything on that machine. (you can freely remove afclient
   and client.rsa files)

3) You can edit config file or just type from the console: (to use config type -f <cfgfile>)
	$ ./afserver
   This will work, if you want to use default values:
   - hostname will be taken from hostname function (it would be ideally, if there is
     appropriate registration in /etc/hosts)
   - server will be listening for users on port 50127
   - server will be listening for client on port 50126
   - server will be for maximum 5 users
   - server will forward tcp packets
   - there will be no logging and no verbose messages
   - there will be no password identification

4) We use make on our machine (we can delete everything apart afclient and client.rsa)

5) We are typing from the console:
	$ ./afclient -n <name of the server> -p 80
   Where <name of the server> is a string like : 'bastion.univ.gda.pl' or '153.19.7.200'

6) We can now enter with webbrowser to : <name of the server>:50127 and we will enter to our
   computer in the fact.

EXAMPLE 2:

Let's see how to use af to forward udp packets. Suppose we want to create a game server
on our computer (udp port 27960 on our machine):

1) - 4) is the same like in example 1. (but we add option: -t udp)

5) We are typing from the console:
	$ ./afclient -u -n <name of the server> -p 27960
   Where <name of the server> is a name (or ip) of a host where our server is running.

6) Connecting to our game is more complicated. User must use afclient to do this.
   He has to specify server he is connecting to and port which his program will be listening on:
        $ ./afclient -U -d <hostname> -p <portnum> -n <name of the server> -m <server port>
   Where <hostname> is name of user machine (who wants to connect to our game). <portnum>
   is a port he will be connecting to. <name of the server> is a name of a host where our server
   is running. <server port> is a port on which server is listening for users.
   In order to connect to our game, user have to connect to <hostname>:<portnum>.
