# This is an example configuration file for active port forwarder
# Firstly, we have to declare our files with key and certificate

certificate	cacert.pem

# Please note, that we can place only blank characters between words

key		server.rsa

# when we want to log some information, we specify file for lightlog
# when we want to log everything - we do this by using heavylog option

# type		name of file

lightlog	logfile
#heavylog	logfile

# we we could also want to use sockets instead of files

# type          port (on localhost)

#lightsocklog   12345
#heavysocklog   12345

#dateformat %d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S

# And it's time to create forwarding targets (named realms here)

#realm indicates a new set of commands to a server
#realmname is optional
realm my realm

#options        values

#hostname  <yourhostname> #this is the name of the server (used to choose interface)
listen    50127          #portnumber on which server is listening for users
manage    50126         #portnumber on which server is listening for afclient
#users     5           #amount of users we are allowing to connect (>0) (default: 5)
#timeout   5          #timeout value for the client's connection (>0) (default: 5)
#clients   1          #number of allowed clients for this realm (>0) (default: 1)
#usrpcli   $users     #allowed users per client for this realm (>0) (default: $users)
#climode   1          #strategy used for connecting users with clients (1) (default: 1)
#proto     tcp       #type of the realm (which protocol it will forward (tcp|udp) (default: tcp)
#pass   mypassword  #this is a password used for client identification
#raclients 1         #number of allowed clients in remote administration mode (>0) (default: 1)
#nossl                #don't use ssl for data transfer
#nozlib                #don't use zlib
#baseport               #listenports are temporary and differ for each client
#dnslookups              #try to obtain dns names of the computers
#ipv4                   #use ipv4 only
#ipv6                  #use ipv6 only

# and now the second realm

realm
listen    50125
manage    50124
