.SH NAME
afserver.conf \- Configuration File for afserver
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B Afserver
supports several mechanisms to supply configuration and run-time parameters: command line options,
.B afserver.conf
and hard-coded defaults. When the same information is supplied in more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used. When configuration file is used (option:
.IR "-f FILE")
command line options like
.IR --hostname ,
.IR --listenport ,
.I --manageport
and
.I --pass
are ignored. Options from configuration file are taken before values from command line (with the exception of
.IR --cerfile ,
.I --keyfile
and
.I --dateformat
). When something is not declared, hard-coded values are used.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Afserver
uses configuration file, which name is supplied by the
.I -f FILE
option. The
.B afserver.conf
file is composed of two sections which have to be in fixed order. In first section global values like cerfile, keyfile and logging options are set. The second section starts with first
.B realm
command and includes options describing specific realms. There may be several
